This repo will serve as referencing for later projects as well as a documentation for this class along with the projects associated with them.
From this point file names will serve as bookmarks for what projects do what along with what the assignment involved. 3rd Party libraries will be referenced if they were added to the respected project but otherwise will only need Python (3.10 for my case) to be ran.

Homework 1:
infinitegenerator.py - 
This code is the initial understanding of generators within Python and how they be used      for lazy evaluation and understanding the yield key word. I choose to produce the            fibonacci sequence along with the binary bit sequence for my examples of using it.

Homework 2:
jarrells_sensors.py - 
This code allowed for understanding of how OOP in Python is done with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and so on with the examples of sensors.
